-- Write logic functions (e.g., filter an array, debounce search)

-- Debug existing code

-- Optimize React rendering

✅ 2. Sample Coding Questions
React
-- Build a counter with useState.

📄 5. Portfolio & Resume Tips
Include real projects (live links + GitHub)

-- List technologies used clearly (React, Next.js, TS, Tailwind)

-- Highlight key features (SSR, lazy loading, protected routes, etc.)

-- Add metrics (e.g., “reduced load time by 40%”)
