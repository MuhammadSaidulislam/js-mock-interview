Debug existing code

Optimize React rendering

✅ 2. Sample Coding Questions
React
Build a counter with useState.

Build a custom useDebounce hook.

Build a controlled form input component.

TypeScript
Type this prop object:

ts
Copy
Edit
interface UserProps {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}
Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns an array of numbers.

JavaScript Logic

🗣️ 3. Behavioral Interview Questions
Tell me about yourself.

What’s a project you’re proud of and why?

How do you handle deadlines or pressure?

Have you ever disagreed with a team decision? What did you do?

How do you manage tasks or stay organized during a sprint?

🔐 4. System Design / Architecture (for senior or mid-level roles)

📄 5. Portfolio & Resume Tips
Include real projects (live links + GitHub)

List technologies used clearly (React, Next.js, TS, Tailwind)

Highlight key features (SSR, lazy loading, protected routes, etc.)

Add metrics (e.g., “reduced load time by 40%”)

🚀 6. Extra Tips for Success
Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Frontend Mentor, or CodeSandbox

Stay updated with docs: react.dev, nextjs.org, typescriptlang.org

Record project walk-throughs — interviewers love seeing code + explanation

Know how you solved problems, not just what you built
